			\subsection{Design}
				Starting with a set of specifications, engines and architects seek a cost-effective
				and aesthetic solution that satisfies the specifications.
				Design is an iterative process.

				Design problems are either \concept{overdetermined} or \concept{underdetermined}.
				\begin{description}[nosep]
					\item[Overdetermined] No solution that satisfies all the criteria.
					\item[Underdetermined] Multiple solutions that satisfy all the criteria.
				\end{description}

				Using interactive graphic tools in \concept{computer-aided design (CAD)} occurs in many
				fields.

			\subsection{Simulation and Animation}
				An example is the training of pilots -- using graphical flight simulators increases safety,
				and reduces training expenses.

				The success of simulators led to using computer graphics for animation, as well as VR.

			\subsection{User Interfaces}
				The predominant way of interacting with computers uses a visual paradigm
				that includes windows, icons, menus, and a pointing device.

		\section{A Graphics System}
			\begin{sidenote}{Six Major Elements in a Graphics System}
				\vspace*{-0.5cm}
				\begin{multicols}{2}
					\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
						\item Input devices
						\item Central Processing Unit
						\item Graphics Processing Unit
						\item Memory
						\item Framebuffer
						\item Output devices
					\end{enumerate}
				\end{multicols}
			\end{sidenote}

			\subsection{Pixels and the Framebuffer}
				\begin{itemize}[nosep]
					\item Virtually all modern graphics systems are \concept{raster-based}.
					\item The image seen on the output device is an array -- the \concept{raster}
					-- of picture elements (\concept{pixels}), produced by the graphics system.
					\item Each pixel corresponds to a location in the image.
					\item The pixels are stored in a part of memory called the \concept{framebuffer}.
				\end{itemize}

				\begin{definition}{Framebuffer Properties}
					\begin{description}
						\item[Resolution] The number of pixels in the framebuffer.
						Determines the detail that can be seen in the image.
						\item[Depth (Precision)] The number of bits used for each pixel.
						Determines properties such as how many colors can be represented on a given system.
						For example, a 1-bit deep framebuffer would allow only two colors,
						whereas an 8-bit deep one would allow $2^8$ (256) colors.
					\end{description}
				\end{definition}

				\begin{sidenote}{Color Systems}
					\begin{description}
						\item[Full-color systems] 24 (or more) bits per pixel.
						These systems can display sufficient colors to represent most images realistically.
						These are also called \concept{true-color} systems, or \concept{RGB color} systems,
						because individual groups of bits in each pixel are assigned to each of the primary
						colors -- red, green, and blue -- that are used in most displays.
						\item[High dynamic range (HDR) systems] 12 or more bits for each color component
						(as opposed to the 8 above).
					\end{description}
				\end{sidenote}

				Until recently, framebuffers stored colors in integer formats.
				More recently, floating point has been used, which allows easier support for HDR.

				In a simple system, the framebuffer holds only the colored pixels displayed on the screen.
				However, in most systems, the framebuffer holds far more information, such as depth
				information.
				In these systems, the framebuffer contains multiple buffers, one of which is the
				\concept{color buffer}.

			\subsection{The CPU and GPU}
				In simple systems, there is a single processor, the \concept{central processing unit (CPU)},
				that performs both normal and graphical processing.
				The main graphical function of the processor is to take specifications of graphical
				primitives generated by application programs,
				and to assign values to the pixels in the framebuffer that best represent these entities.

				\begin{definition}{Rasterization}
					Also called \concept{scan conversion}.
					The conversion of geometric entities to pixel colors and locations in the framebuffer.

					\begin{example}[Triangle Rasterization]
						A triangle is specified by three vertices,
						but to display its outline by the three line segments connecting the vertices,
						the graphics system must generate a set of pixels that appear as line segments to the
						viewer.
					\end{example}
				\end{definition}

				In early graphics systems, the framebuffer was part of the standard memory
				that could be directly addressed by the CPU.

				Nowadays, virtually all graphics systems are characterized by special purpose
				\concept{graphics processing units (GPUs)} that are custom-tailored
				to carry out specific graphics functions.
				The GPU can be located on the motherboard, or on a graphics card.
				The framebuffer is accessed through the GPU and is usually on the same circuit board
				as the GPU.

			\subsection{Output Devices}
				\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
					\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{\main/images/chapter01/cathode_ray_tube.jpg}
					\end{center}
					\caption{Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)}
				\end{wrapfigure}

				Until recently, the dominant type of display (or \concept{monitor}) was the
				\concept{cathode-ray tube (CRT)}.

				When electrons strike the phosphor coating on the tube, light is emitted.
				The direction of the beam is controlled by two pairs of deflection plates.

				The output of the computer is converted, by digital-to-analog converters,
				to voltages across the $x$ and $y$ deflection plates.
				Light appears on the surface of the CRT when a sufficiently intense beam of electrons
				is directed at the phosphor.

				A typical CRT emits light for a short time -- usually a few milliseconds
				-- after the phosphor is excited by the electron beam.
				For a human to see a steady, flicker-free image, the same path must be \concept{refreshed},
				by the beam at a sufficiently high rate, called the \concept{refresh rate}.
				In older systems, the refresh rate was determined by the frequency of the power system:
				60 Hz in the US, and 50 Hz in much of the rest of the world.

				\begin{definition}{Vector CRT}
					If the voltages steering the beam change at a constant rate,
					the beam will trace a straight line, visible to the viewer.
					This is called the \mbox{\concept{random-scan}}, \concept{calligraphic},
					or \concept{vector} CRT,
					because the beam can be moved directly from any position to any other position.
					This is the basis of early graphics systems that predated the present raster technology.
				\end{definition}

				\begin{definition}{Raster CRT}
					In a raster system, the graphics system takes pixels from the framebuffer and
					displays them as points on the surface of the display in one of two ways:
					\begin{descriptimize}[nosep]
						\item[Noninterlaced] Pixels are displayed row by row,
						or scan line by scan line, at the refresh rate.
						\item[Interlaced] Odd rows and even rows are refreshed alternately.
						Used in commercial television.
						If the display is operating at 60 Hz, the screen is redrawn only 30 times per second.
					\end{descriptimize}
				\end{definition}

				Color CRTs have three different-colored phosphors (red, green, and blue),
				arranged in small groups.
				A common style is to arrange them in triangular groups called \concept{triads},
				where each triad consists of three phosphors: one for each primary color.
				Most color CRTs have three electron beams, corresponding to the types of phosphors.

				In the shadow-mask CRT, a metal screen with small holes (the \concept{shadow-mask})
				ensures that an electron beam excites only phosphors of the proper color.

				CRTs are still common display devices, but are being replaced by flat-screen technologies.
				Flat-panel monitors are inherently raster-based.
				All technologies available -- including light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
				liquid-crystal displays (LCD's), and plasma panels --
				use a two-dimensional grid to address individual light-emitting elements.
				\pagebreak

				\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
					\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{\main/images/chapter01/flat_panel_display.jpg}
					\end{center}
					\caption{Generic Flat-Panel Display}
				\end{wrapfigure}

				A flat-panel display works as follows:

				The two outside plates each contain parallel grids of wires that are oriented perpendicular
				to each other.
				By sending electrical signals to the proper wire in each grid,
				the electrical field at the intersection of the two wires
				can be made strong enough to control the corresponding element in the middle plate.

				The middle plate in an LED panel contains light-emitting diodes
				that can be turned on and off by the electrical signals sent on the grid.
				In an LCD, the electrical field controls the polarization of the liquid crystals in
				the middle panel,
				thus turning on and off light passing through the panel.
				A plasma panel uses the voltages on the grids to energize gases embedded between the
				glass panels holding the grids.
				The energized gas becomes a glowing plasma.

				Most projection systems are raster-based.
				They use a variety of technologies including CRTs and digital light projection (DLP).
				These systems act as standard monitors with similar resolutions and perspectives.
				Hard-copy devices, such as printers and plotters, are also raster-based, but cannot be
				refreshed.

				Stereo (3D) television displays use alternate refresh cycles to switch the display
				between an image for the left eye and an image for the right eye.
				The viewer wears special glasses that are coupled to the refresh cycle.

			\subsection{Input Devices}
				Most graphics systems provide a keyboard and at least one other input device.
				The most common input devices are the mouse, the joystick, and the data tablet.
				Each of these provides positional information to the system,
				and is usually equipped with one or more buttons to provide signals to the processor.
				These devices are often called \concept{pointing devices},
				and allow a user to indicate a particular location on the display.

				Due to new input devices appearing regularly,
				our graphics programs should implement a flexible model for incorporating input devices.

		\section{Images: Physical and Synthetic}
			\subsection{Objects and Viewers}
				Every image formation process contains two basic entities:
				\concept{object} and \concept{viewer}.
				The object exists in space independent of any image formation process, and any viewer.
				In computer graphics, objects are formed by specifying positions in space of various
				geometric primitives.
				A set of locations in space, or of \concept{vertices}, is sufficient to define or
				approximate most objects.

				To form an image from an object, we need someone or something that is viewing the object.
				The \emph{viewer} forms the image of our objects.
				In the human visual system, the image is formed on the back of the eye.
				In a camera, the image is formed in the film plane.
				An image is a specific \emph{view} of an object -- viewers in a different relative
				location will have different images of the same object.

				Objects and viewers exist in three-dimensional space,
				but the image that is defined is two-dimensional.

			\subsection{Light and Images}
				An image must have a light source.
				Light from the source strikes various surfaces of the object,
				and a portion of the reflected light enters the camera through the lens.

				\begin{definition}{Light}
					A form of magnetic radiation.

					Electromagnetic energy travels as waves that can be characterized either by
					their wavelengths or their frequencies.
					The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, infrared, and a portion that
					causes a response in our visual systems.

					This \concept{visual spectrum} is called \concept{light},
					and has wavelengths in the range of $350$ to $780$ nanometers (nm).

					A given light source has a color determined by the energy that it emits at various
					wavelengths.

					\begin{indentparagraph}
						\begin{descriptimize}[nosep]
							\item[450 nm] blue
							\item[520 nm] green
							\item[650 nm] red
						\end{descriptimize}
					\end{indentparagraph}
				\end{definition}

				Light sources can emit light either as a set of discrete frequencies,
				or over a continuous range.

				In computer graphics, we rarely need to deal with the physical properties of light.
				Instead, we use \concept{geometric optics}.

				\begin{definition}{Geometric Optics}
					This method models light sources as emitters of light energy,
					each of which have a fixed intensity.

					In this model, light travels in straight lines,
					from the sources to those objects with which it interacts.
				\end{definition}

				An ideal \concept{point source} emits energy from a single location
				at one or more frequencies equally in all directions.
				A particular source is characterized by the
				intensity of light it emits at each frequency and
				by that light's directionality.

			\subsection{Imaging Models}
				There are multiple approaches to forming images from a set of objects,
				the light-reflecting properties of these objects, and
				the properties of the light sources in the scene.

				We can start by building an imaging model by following light from a source.

				\begin{definition}{Ray}
					A semi-infinite line that emanates from a point and
					travels to infinity in a particular direction.
				\end{definition}

				Because light travels in straight lines, we can think in terms of rays of light
				emanating in all directions from our point source.
				A portion of these infinite rays contributes to the image on the film plane of our camera.
				Most of the rays go off to infinity, neither entering the camera directly nor striking any
				of the objects.
				The remaining rays strike and illuminate objects.

				\concept{Ray tracing} and \concept{photon mapping} are image formation techniques
				that are based on these ideas and that can form the basis for producing computer-generated
				images.
				We can use ray-tracing to simulate complex physical effects,
				if we are willing to carry our the requisite computing.
				Ray-tracing is usually not well-suited for real-time computation.

				Other physical approaches to image formation are based on conservation of energy.
				The most important in computer graphics is \concept{radiosity},
				which works best for services that scatter the incoming light equally in all directions.
				However, radiosity still requires more computation than can be done in real time.
