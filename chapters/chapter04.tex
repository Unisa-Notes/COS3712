      \subsection{Points, Vectors, and Scalars}
        \begin{description}
          \item[Point] Represented graphically by a single dot.
            A position or location specified by three values placed in parentheses $(x, y, z)$.
            The point $(0, 0, 0)$ represents the point where the three axes intersect
            with the value 0, and is referred to as the \concept{origin}.
            We generally use lowercase letters $p$, $q$ and $r$ to refer to points.
          \item[Vector] Represented graphically by an arrow.
            A direction with a magnitude.
            Also normally written in parentheses, but \emph{does not} specify a position.
            A vector does not have a position.
            We generally use lowercase letters $u$, $v$ and $w$ to refer to vectors.

            Do not confuse a vector with a \concept{line~segment}.
            A line~segment has a begin and endpoint (unlike a vector)
            and does not point in one of two possible directions
            (whereas a vector does).
          \item[Scalar] A value or magnitude.
            Has neither position nor direction.
            We generally use lowercase letters of the Greek alphabet $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$
            to represent arbitrary scalars, but sometimes lowercase letters of the alphabet.
        \end{description}

        \begin{sidenote}{Expressing Points and Vectors in Homogeneous Coordinates}
          We can distinguish between points and vectors by expressing them in four dimensions:
          adding a fourth coordinate.
          For a point, the fourth coordinate is 1, and for a vector it is 0.
        \end{sidenote}

      \subsection{Adding and Subtracting Vectors and Points}
        We can add two vectors together, or subtract two vectors from one another.
        We can add a vector to a point (or subtract, which is just adding in the opposite direction).
        We cannot add two points together, but we can subtract one point from another.

        \begin{description}
          \item[Sum of Two Vectors] Produces a \emph{vector}.
            Add the corresponding coordinates.
          \item[Difference Between Two Vectors] Produces a \emph{vector}.
            Subtract the corresponding coordinates.
          \item[Sum of a Point and a Vector] Produces a \emph{point}.
            Add the corresponding coordinates.
          \item[Difference Between Two Points] Produces a \emph{vector}.
            Subtract the corresponding coordinates.
        \end{description}

      \subsection{Multiplying and Dividing a Vector by a Scalar}
        The product of a vector and a scalar is a \emph{vector}.
        Multiply each of the coordinates by the scalar.
        This increases the magnitude of a vector without changing its direction.
        Similarly, we can divide a vector by a scalar.

      \subsection{Magnitude of a Vector}
        The magnitude of a vector is a \emph{scalar}.
        It is the square root of the sum of the squares of its coordinates.
        Written $\lvert v \rvert$.

        If $v$ is the vector $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$, then 
        \begin{align*}
          \lvert v \rvert = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
        \end{align*}

        \begin{example}
          If $v = (3, 0, 4)$, then
          \begin{align*}
            \lvert v \rvert = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
                            = \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + 4^2}
                            = \sqrt{9 + 0 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
          \end{align*}
        \end{example}

        The magnitude of a vector represents its size, without specifying its direction.

      \subsection{Normalising a Vector}
        A \concept{normalised vector} is a vector with a magnitude of 1.
        To normalise a vector, we divide it by its magnitude.
        \begin{align*}
          \mathbf{n} = \frac{v}{\lvert v \rvert}
        \end{align*}

      \subsection{Dot Product of Two Vectors}
        The \concept{dot product} (also called the \concept{inner product}) of two vectors
        is a \emph{scalar}.
        It is the sum of the products of the two vectors.
        Written $u \cdot v$.

        If $u$ and $v$ are vectors, and $u$ is defined as $(u_x, u_y, u_z)$ and $v$ as $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$,
        then
        \begin{align*}
          u \cdot v = (u_x \cdot v_x) + (u_y \cdot v_y) + (u_z \cdot v_z)
        \end{align*}

        \begin{sidenote}{Angle Between Two Vectors}
          The angle $\theta$ between two vectors can be calculated using:
          \begin{align*}
            \cos(\theta) = \frac{u \cdot v}{\lvert u \rvert \lvert v \rvert}
          \end{align*}
        \end{sidenote}

      \pagebreak

      \subsection{Cross Product of Two Vectors}
        The cross product of two vectors is a \emph{vector}.
        Each coordinate is calculated as the difference between the products of the
        other two vectors.
        Written $u \times v$.

        If $u$ and $v$ are vectors, and $u$ is defined as $(u_x, u_y, u_z)$ and $v$ as $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$,
        then
        \begin{align*}
          u \times v &= \bigl((u_y \cdot v_z - u_z \cdot v_y), - (u_x \cdot v_z - u_z \cdot v_x), (u_x \cdot v_y - u_y \cdot v_x)\bigr)\\
                     &= \bigl((u_y \cdot v_z - u_z \cdot v_y), (u_z \cdot v_x - u_x \cdot v_z), (u_x \cdot v_y - u_y \cdot v_x)\bigr)
        \end{align*}

        Remembering this exact formula is tricky.
        One way to do it is to write them down in columns, and then ignore the column
        for the specific coordinate.
        With that, every even column should be negated.

        \begin{example}
          If $u = (1, 2, 3)$ and $v = (-1, 0, 1)$, then
          \begin{align*}
            u \times v &= \bigl((u_y \cdot v_z - u_z \cdot v_y), - (u_x \cdot v_z - u_z \cdot v_x),
              (u_x \cdot v_y - u_y \cdot v_x)\bigr)\\
                       &= \bigl((2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot 0), - (1 \cdot 1 - (3)(-1)), (2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot 0)\bigr)\\
                       &= \bigl(2, - (4), 2\bigr)\\
                       &= (2, -4, 2)
          \end{align*}
        \end{example}

        The cross product is useful for calculating a vector normal (at right angles)
        to two vectors.
        You can see that $u \times v = n$ is at right angles to $u$ and $v$ by calculating
        the dot product of $n$~and~$u$ and $n$~and~$v$.
        If $\cos(\theta) = 0$, then $\theta = 90$ degrees.

      \subsection{Lines}
        In 2D, the equation of a line is
        \begin{center}
          $y = mx + c$\\
          $ax + by + c = 0$
        \end{center}

        In 3D, to specify the equation of a line we can use a set of Cartesian equations:
        \begin{align*}
          \frac{x - q_1}{d_1} = \frac{y - q_2}{d_2} = \frac{z - q_3}{d_3}
        \end{align*}
        where $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are scalars,
        and $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the coordinates of any point on the line.

        An alternative way of specifying lines in three dimensions is using
        \concept{parametric~equations}.
        Suppose we have a point $q$ on the line, and a vector $d$ pointing in the direction
        of the line.
        Then the following parametric equation specifies the coordinates of any point $p$
        on the line:
        \begin{align*}
          p = q + \gamma d
        \end{align*}
        where $\gamma$ is a scalar value.

        This is related to the Cartesian equations:
        \begin{align*}
          (x, y, z) = (q_1, q_2, q_3) + \gamma (d_1, d_2, d_3)
        \end{align*}
        If we separate the coordinates into different equations, and express those equations
        in terms of $\gamma$, we get the Cartesian equations.

        If one of the components of the direction vector is zero, the Cartesian equations
        turn out to be the equation of a line in 2 dimensions.

        We can also specify a line by means of a parametric equation if we have two points
        $q$ and $r$ on the line:
        \begin{align*}
          p = q + \gamma (r - q)
        \end{align*}
        Here, $r - q$ determines the direction vector.
        For values of $\gamma$ between 0 and 1, we have all the points on the line~segment
        between $r$ and $q$.

        Sometimes, the parametric equation of a line is rearranged in the form
        \begin{align*}
          p = \gamma r + (1 - \gamma)q
        \end{align*}

      \subsection{Planes}
        A \concept{plane} (in three dimensions) can be specified by means of an equation
        of the form
        \begin{align*}
          ax + by + cz + d = 0
        \end{align*}
        where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are scalars, and $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the coordinates
        of any point in the plane.
        (As it turns out, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the components of a vector normal -- perpendicular -- to the plane).

        The equation $x + 2y + 3z - 4 = 0$ is the equation of a plane with the vector $(1, 2, 3)$
        perpendicular to it.

        \begin{sidenote}{Determining the Equation of a Plane}
          $ $\vspace{-1em}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given a point $q$ on the plane, and a vector $n$ normal to the plane,
              the equation
              \begin{align*}
                n_1x + n_2y + n_3z + d = 0
              \end{align*}
              will define the plane.
              To get the scalar for $d$, substitute the coordinates of point $q$ and solve.
            \item Given a point $q$ on the plane, and two vectors $u$ and $v$ in the plane,
              the cross product $u \times v$ will give a normal to the plane.
              Then use the method above.
            \item Given three non-collinear points $q$, $r$ and $s$ in the plane,
              use two pairs of these points to determine two vectors in the plane
              by subtracting the points from one another.
              Then use the methods above to find a normal to the plane and then determine
              the equation of the plane.
            \item Given a line in the plane and a point $r$ in the plane.
              The line must be specified in some way: a set of Cartesian equations
              or a parametric equation.
              Then two vectors in the plane will be the direction vector $d = (d_1, d_2, d_3)$
              and the vector $q - r$.
              Now we have two vectors and a point on the plane, and can follow the previous methods
              to determine the equation of the plane.
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{sidenote}

        Planes can also be specified by means of parametric equations:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Given a point $q$ and two (linearly independent) vectors $u$ and $v$ in the plane:
            the equation
            \begin{align*}
              p = q + \alpha u + \beta v
            \end{align*}
            will specify all points $p$ on the plane.
          \item Given three non-collinear points $q$, $r$ and $s$, $q - r$ and $q - s$
            will give two linearly independent vectors in the plane.
            The equation
            \begin{align*}
              p = q + \alpha (q - r) + \beta (q - s)
            \end{align*}
            will then specify all points $p$ on the plane.
            For values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ between 0 and 1, this equation gives all points
            in the triangle formed by $q$, $r$ and $s$.
        \end{enumerate}

      \subsection{Matrices}
        A two-dimensional \concept{matrix} is a table of values with a fixed number of rows
        and columns.
        The values are generally placed in a single pair of extended square brackets.

        \begin{definition}{Transpose of a Matrix}
          The \concept{transpose} of a matrix is another matrix with all its row and column values
          swapped.
          If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, then the transpose of $A$, written $A^T$,
          is the $n \times m$ matrix with the entries swapped.
        \end{definition}

        \begin{definition}{Matrix Addition and Subtraction}
          Matrix addition is only defined for two matrices that have the same number of rows
          and columns, and their sum is another matrix,
          with the same number of rows and columns.
        \end{definition}

        The product of two matrices is used for transformations.
        If we want to translate, scale, or rotate an object, we multiply each of its points
        by the applicable transformation matrix.

        \begin{definition}{Determinant of a Matrix}
          The \concept{determinant} of a matrix is a scalar, and can only be calculated for
          square matrices.
          \begin{align*}
            \lvert A \rvert &= \sum \alpha_{ij} C_{ij}\\
            C_{ij} &= (-1)^{i + j} M_{ij}
          \end{align*}
          where $M_{ij}$ is the minor of matrix $A$ -- the matrix formed by eliminating
          row~$i$ and column~$j$ from $A$.
        \end{definition}

        If the determinant of a matrix is 0, the vectors inside the matrix are linearly dependent.

    \section{Three Dimensional Primitives}
      \begin{sidenote}{Features of 3D Objects That Work with Existing Graphics}
        $ $\vspace{-1em}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The objects are described by their surfaces and can be thought of as being hollow.
          \item The objects can be specified through a set of vertices in three dimensions.
          \item The objects are either composed of, or can be approximated by, flat, convex polygons.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{sidenote}

    \pagebreak

    \section{Frames in WebGL}
      \begin{sidenote}{Order of Frames in the Pipeline}
        Note that the names have changed between the versions, for the first two.

        \begin{descriptenum}
          \item[Model Coordinates] (In the older version, \concept{object (or model) coordinates}).
            In most applications, we tend to specify or use
            an object with a convenient size, orientation, and location in its own frame,
            called the \concept{model~frame}.
          \item[Object (or World) Coordinates] (In the older version,
            \concept{world (or application) coordinates}).
            A scene may comprise many objects.
            The application program generally applies a sequence of transformations to each object
            to size, orient, and position it within a frame that is appropriate for that particular
            application.
            The application frame is called the \concept{world frame},
            and the values are in \concept{world coordinates}.
            If we do not model with predefined objects, or apply any transformations before
            we specify our geometry, model and world/object coordinates are the same.
          \item[Eye (or Camera) Coordinates] Virtually all graphics systems use a frame
            whose origin is the center of the camera's lens, and whose axes are aligned
            with the sides of the camera.
            This frame is called the \concept{camera (or eye) frame}.
            There are $4 \times 4$ matrices that represent the transformation from the
            model coordinates to world coordinates, and from world coordinates to eye coordinates.
            These transformations are normally concatenated together into the
            \concept{model-view transformation}, which is specified by the model-view matrix.
          \item[Clip Coordinates] Once objects are in eye coordinates, WebGL must check whether
            they lie within the view volume.
            If an object does not, it is clipped from the scene prior to rasterisation.
            WebGL can carry out this process most efficiently if it fist carries out a projection
            transformation that brings all potentially visible objects into a cube centered
            at the origin in \concept{clip coordinates}.
          \item[Normalised Device Coordinates] At this stage, vertices are still represented
            in homogeneous coordinates.
            The division by the $w$ component, called \concept{perspective~division},
            yields 3D representations in \concept{normalised device coordinates}.
          \item[Window (or Screen) Coordinates] Takes a position in normalised device coordinates,
            and, taking into account the viewport, creates a 3D representation in
            \concept{window coordinates}.
            Window coordinates are measured in units of pixels on the display,
            but retain depth information.
            If we remove the depth coordinate, we are working with 2D \concept{screen coordinates}.
        \end{descriptenum}
      \end{sidenote}

      The application programmer usually works with two frames: the \concept{model frame}
      and the \concept{view frame}.
      By concatenating the transformation that takes the model frame to the object frame
      with the transformation that takes the object frame to the eye frame,
      we form the model-view matrix that positions objects relative to the eye frame.

      In WebGL, we can set a model-view matrix by sending an array of 16~elements to the
      vertex shader.
